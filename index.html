                <p class="lead mx-auto">At Kemet Gift, we believe history shouldn't just be read; it should be held. We don't make souvenirs that fade; we forge connections that last.</p>

                 <h2>1. Material Integrity (Solid Brass)</h2>
                 <p>We rejected common alloys that feel hollow. History is heavy, and so are our pieces. Each medal is crafted from <strong>solid, high-density brass or bronze</strong>, providing an authentic weight (approx. 37.5g) and a metallic resonance that cheap replicas cannot mimic.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                 <h2>2. The Minting Process (Forged, Not Poured)</h2>
                 <p>Our pieces are not cast in molds; they are struck with immense pressure. Using hardened steel dies and advanced <strong>multi-striking techniques</strong>, we achieve museum-grade relief depth and razor-sharp details that honor the complexity of ancient Egyptian art.</p>

             <div class="content-block">
                 <h2>3. The Ritual of Unboxing</h2>
                 <p>The box is not just a wrapper; it is the first chapter of the story. From rigid kraft boxes to premium soft-touch casing, the packaging is engineered to build anticipation and respect for the artifact inside.</p>
